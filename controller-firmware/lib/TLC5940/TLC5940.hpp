/**
  *  This class controls a TLC5940 PWM driver IC.
  *  It supports sending dot correction and grayscale data. However, it does not support error checking or writing the EEPROM.
  *  This class uses the FastPWM library by Erik Olieman to continuously pulse the GSLCK pin without CPU intervention. After
  *  4096 pulses, the private member funciton reset is called by the ticker. It resets the display by pulsing the BLANK pin. If new
  *  data has been set to be sent by the functions setNewGSData or setNewDCData, it is sent here. The definition GSCLK_SPEED in TLC5940.h
  *  controls how often this function is called. A higher GSCLK_SPEED will increase the rate at which the screen is updated but also increase
  *  CPU time spent in that function. The default value is 1Mhz. The rate at which the reset function is called can be calculated by:
  *  (1/GSCLK_SPEED) * 4096.
  *

  *  // Create the TLC5940 instance
  *  TLC5940 tlc(p7, p5, p21, p9, p10, p11, p12, 1);

  *      unsigned short GSData[16] = { 0x0000 };

  *      GSData[0] = 0xFFF;
